# Coronavirus Twitter Analysis: 2020
The Coronavirus Twitter Analysis Project looks at data from the millions of tweets sent throughout 2020. The objective of this project was to sort through data and get comfortable with MapReduce, shell script commands, as well as figuring out how to plot the data on usable graphs. The project was completed for the 2023 Spring section of Data Structures and Algorithms at Claremont McKenna College at the Claremont Colleges Consortium.  

In order to iterate thorugh this large amount of data, I coded and excecuted four python programs:  `map.py`, `reduce.py`, `alternative_reduce.py`, and `visualize.py`. Each of these fulfills a part of the three steps of MapReduce(map, reduce,and visualize), with the program 'alternate_reduce.py' combining the reduce and visualize steps. The graphs below are the outputs of first, the visualize program, and secondly the alterate_reduce program.
